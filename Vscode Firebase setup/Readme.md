# Setting Up Firebase ☁️

### What is Firebase?

Firebase is a powerful Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform developed by Google that provides developers with a suite of tools and services to build, manage, and grow applications efficiently. It offers various features, including real-time databases, user authentication, cloud storage, and hosting, making it easier to develop high-quality apps without extensive backend coding.

Firebase is categorized as a NoSQL database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. This allows for flexible data structures and real-time synchronization across all connected clients, ensuring that users see the most up-to-date information even when they are offline. Firebase also supports user authentication through various methods, including email/password, Google, Facebook, and more.

### Step 1: Create a Firebase Project
Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

### Step 2: Log In to Firebase
To log in to Firebase, follow these steps:
1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Click on **"Go to Console"** in the top right corner.
3. If prompted, sign in with your Google account credentials. If you don’t have a Google account, you will need to create one.
4. Once logged in, you will be directed to your Firebase projects dashboard.

### Step 3: Name Your Project
Click on create new project to start with the new project.

### Step 4: Name Your Project
For consistency, let’s name our project **"TechnoVIT-PJT"** and click on **Continue**.

### Step 5: Enable Analytics
Check the box to allow Google Analytics for your project and click **Continue**.

### Step 6: Configure Google Analytics
Choose or create a Google Analytics account. If no account is available, create a new one using the pop-up. Then, select **Create Project**.

### Step 7: Project Ready
Your project will be ready and configured in a minute or two, and you can start coding! 🎉

# Setting Up Rules for Database and CRUD Operations 🔒

### Step 1: Access the Database Section
1. Click on the three horizontal bars (☰) in the top left corner of the Firebase console to open the navigation menu.

### Step 2: Navigate to Realtime Database
2. Select **Build** from the menu, then click on **Realtime Database**. This will take you to the section where you can manage your database.

### Step 3: Create a Database
3. Click on **Create Database** and choose **Next**. You will be prompted to select a starting mode for your Firebase Security Rules:
   - **Test Mode**: This option allows anyone to read and write data to your database. It’s useful for initial testing but should not be used in production.
   - **Locked Mode**: This option denies all reads and writes from mobile and web clients. Only authenticated application servers can access your database.

   For now, select **Test Mode** to get started, and then click on **Enable**.

### Step 4: Database Creation Confirmation
4. Your database will be created and ready for use in just a minute or two! 🎉 You will see a dashboard with options for **Data**, **Rules**, **Backups**, and **Usage**.

### Step 5: Set Database Rules
5. Go to the **Rules** tab. Here, you will define the access permissions for your database. Paste the following code to allow read and write operations for all users:

   ```json
   {
     "rules": {
       ".read": true,
       ".write": true
     }
   }
   ```

   This configuration makes your database publicly accessible, which is suitable for testing but not recommended for production applications. 

### Step 6: Add Data to Your Database
6. To add data, hover over the URL of your database, which will look something like this: `https://technovit-pjt-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/`. You should see an **Add** option. Click on it to create a new key-value pair:
   - **Key:** `led_status`
   - **Value:** `0`

   After entering the key and value, click on **Add**. This action will store the data in your database, and you’re almost done with setting up Firebase for your project! 💪

### Step 7: Review and Discuss
7. Now that your Firebase project is set up, let's discuss any questions or doubts you may have about the process or Firebase in general. 💬

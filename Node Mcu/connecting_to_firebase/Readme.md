## Step 6: Obtain Your Firebase Configuration
To integrate Firebase Authentication into your web application, you need to obtain your Firebase configuration details:

1. Go to the **Project settings** by clicking on the gear icon next to **Project Overview**.
2. In the **General** tab, scroll down to find your **Firebase SDK snippet**.
3. Copy the configuration object, which looks like this:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};
```

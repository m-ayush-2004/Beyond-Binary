# README.md

## Overview

This README provides an explanation of the provided NodeMCU code, which sets up a simple web server that allows you to control an LED via HTTP requests. The code uses the ESP8266 or ESP32 microcontroller to connect to a Wi-Fi network and listen for incoming client requests to toggle the state of an LED.

## Libraries Used

The code includes several libraries necessary for Wi-Fi connectivity and web server functionality:

```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <Arduino.h>
#ifdef ESP32
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <AsyncTCP.h>
#else
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <ESPAsyncTCP.h>
#endif
#include <ESPAsyncWebServer.h>
```

- **ESP8266WiFi.h**: Provides Wi-Fi functionality for the ESP8266 microcontroller.
- **WiFi.h**: Used for the ESP32 microcontroller for Wi-Fi connectivity.
- **ESPAsyncWebServer.h**: Allows for asynchronous handling of web server requests, enabling non-blocking operations.

## Wi-Fi Configuration

The following lines set up the Wi-Fi credentials:

```cpp
const char* ssid = "Ayush";
const char* pass = "ayush2004";
```

- **ssid**: The name of the Wi-Fi network to connect to.
- **pass**: The password for the Wi-Fi network.

## Setup Function

The `setup()` function is called once when the program starts. It initializes the serial communication, sets up the LED pin, and connects to the Wi-Fi network:

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // Initialize serial communication at 9600 baud rate
  delay(10);
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT); // Set the LED pin as an output
  digitalWrite(led, LOW); // Turn off the LED initially
  Serial.println();
  Serial.print("connecting to :");
  Serial.println(ssid);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, pass); // Start the Wi-Fi connection
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    delay(500);
    Serial.print("."); // Print dots while connecting
  }
  Serial.println();
  Serial.println("WiFi connected");
  server.begin(); // Start the web server
  Serial.println("server started");
  Serial.print("Use this URL to connect to the program: ");
  Serial.print(WiFi.localIP()); // Print the local IP address
  Serial.print("/");
}
```

### Key Steps in `setup()`:

1. **Serial Communication**: Initializes serial communication for debugging.
2. **LED Pin Setup**: Configures the built-in LED pin as an output.
3. **Wi-Fi Connection**: Connects to the specified Wi-Fi network and waits until connected.
4. **Web Server Initialization**: Starts the web server on port 80 and prints the local IP address for access.

## Loop Function

The `loop()` function runs continuously after the `setup()` function. It checks for incoming client connections and processes requests:

```cpp
void loop() {
  // Check if a client has connected
  WiFiClient client = server.available();
  if (!client) {
    return; // Exit if no client is connected
  }

  Serial.println("new client");
  while (!client.available()) {
    delay(1); // Wait for client data
  }

  // Read the first line of the request
  String request = client.readStringUntil('\r');
  Serial.println("user requested :");
  Serial.print(request);
  client.flush();
```

### Key Steps in `loop()`:

1. **Client Connection Check**: Uses `server.available()` to check for a connected client.
2. **Request Handling**: Reads the HTTP request from the client and logs it to the serial monitor.

## Controlling the LED

The code checks the incoming request to determine whether to turn the LED on or off:

```cpp
  if (request.indexOf("/LED=OFF") != -1) {
    digitalWrite(led, HIGH); // Turn the LED off
  }
  if (request.indexOf("/LED=ON") != -1) {
    digitalWrite(led, LOW); // Turn the LED on
  }

  client.println("user requested " + request); // Send response back to the client
}
```

### Key Steps for LED Control:

- **Turning Off the LED**: If the request contains `/LED=OFF`, the LED is turned off by setting the pin HIGH.
- **Turning On the LED**: If the request contains `/LED=ON`, the LED is turned on by setting the pin LOW.
- **Response to Client**: Sends back a confirmation message to the client indicating the request received.

## How to Use the Web Server

1. **Upload the Code**: Upload the provided code to your NodeMCU or ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE.
2. **Open Serial Monitor**: Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the connection status and the local IP address.
3. **Connect to the Web Server**: In a web browser, enter the URL shown in the Serial Monitor (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100/`).
4. **Control the LED**: Use the following URLs to control the LED:
   - To turn the LED **ON**: `http://<your_ip_address>/LED=ON`
   - To turn the LED **OFF**: `http://<your_ip_address>/LED=OFF`

Replace `<your_ip_address>` with the actual IP address displayed in the Serial Monitor.
